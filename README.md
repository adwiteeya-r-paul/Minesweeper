**Game Details**

- There is a 5*5 game area and 3 hidden mines. 
- On the UI, there exists a checkbox, which determines what happens if a tile is clicked on. The player can either:
o Place a flag [Flag mode on]
o “Try” a tile [Flag mode off]
- If the player clicks on a tile in the “Try a tile” mode then:
o If they hit a mine, the game ends.
o If they did not hit a mine, a number appears on that field indicating how many mines
are nearby.
- If the player clicks on a field in the “Place a flag” mode then:
o If they flagged a field but there is no mine, the game ends.
o If they flagged a field and there are no more mines, the game ends and the player
wins!
